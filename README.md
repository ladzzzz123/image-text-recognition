Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Label Detection in Patent Images

Written by : Taehoon Kim, jamesk1228@gmail.com, Sogang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea

Objective: Detect digits from black & white patent images.

Prerequsites: python3, tensorflow, scikit-image, numpy, opencv-python (Recommand using anaconda)

How-to: 
1. Clone this git repository 
2. For pre-trained MNIST Handwritten digit Convolutional Neural Network model, 
   go to https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7TzarHysU5fNXlwMF9Cb0RTV1U
3. Unzip pre-trained model and place it under root git repository.
4. Place your custom image in "images/"
5. To run the code in Jupyter Notebook, use main.ipynb instead of main.py.
6. You can find our raw value and coordinates of labels in patent image from "labels/image_name_label.txt"
